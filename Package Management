Package Management:

Introduction:-

Package in Linux:
In Linux distributions, a “package” refers to a compressed file archive containing all of the files that come with a particular application. The files are usually stored in the package according to their relative installation paths on your system.

Package Management:
package management is a method of installing and maintaining (which includes updating and probably removing as well) software on the system. Package management is a method of installing, updating, removing, and keeping track of software updates from specific repositories (repos) in the Linux system. Linux distros often use different package management tools. 

How package management systems work?
If a certain package requires a certain resource such as a shared library, or another package, it is said to have a dependency. All modern package management systems provide some method of dependency resolution to ensure that when a package is installed, all of its dependencies are installed as well.

Yum Repository:
YUM is the primary package management tool for installing,updating,removing,and managing software packages in linux.
YUM performs dependency resolution when installing ,updating and removing sofware packages.
YUM can manages packages from installed repositories in the system.
Its easy to manage packages in linux with YUM.
There are many options and commands available to use with YUM.
