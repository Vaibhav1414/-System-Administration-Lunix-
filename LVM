LVM
LVM stands for Logical Volume Management. It is a system of managing logical volumes, or filesystems, that is much more advanced and flexible than the traditional method of partitioning a disk into one or more segments and formatting that partition with a filesystem.
In Linux, Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a device mapper framework that provides logical volume management for the Linux kernel. Most modern Linux distributions are LVM-aware to the point of being able to have their root file systems on a logical volume.

LVM have 3 concepts
•	Physical Volume (PV): it is a whole disk or a partition of a disk
•	Volume Group (VG): corresponds to one or more PV
•	Logical Volume (LV): represents a portion of a VG. A LV can only belong to one VG. It’s on a LV that we can create a file system.

Commands for the LVM are as following:
1.pvcreate => to create a physical volume
2.pvdisplay => to display the physical volume
3.vgcreate vgname[pv] => to create a volume group
4.vgdisplay => to display the volume group
5.lvcreate -n name -L[size] name =>to create a logical volume
6.lvdisplay => to display the logical volume

How to setup Linux LVM ?
1.	Login with root user ID
2.	Using the whole new hard disk for LVM partition:
    fdisk /dev/xvdf
3.	Follow This Steps!
4.	At the Linux fdisk command prompt,
1.	press n to create a new disk partition,
2.	press p to create a primary disk partition,
3.	press 1 to denote it as 1st disk partition,
4.	press ENTER twice to accept the default of 1st and last cylinder – to convert the whole   
    secondary hard disk to a single disk partition,
5.	press t (will automatically select the only partition – partition 1) to change the default  
    Linux partition type (0x83) to LVM partition type (0x8e),
6.	press L to list all the currently supported partition type,
7.	press 8e (as per the L listing) to change partition 1 to 8e, i.e. Linux LVM partition type,
8.	press p to display the secondary hard disk partition setup. Please take note that the first 
    partition is denoted as /dev/hdb1 in Linux,
9.	press w to write the partition table and exit fdisk upon completion.
5.	Next, this LVM command will create a LVM physical volume (PV) on a regular hard disk or partition:
    pvcreate /dev/xvdf1
6.	Now, another LVM command to create a LVM volume group (VG) called vg0 with a physical extent size (PE size) of 16MB:
    vgcreate -s 16M vg0 /dev/xvdf1
7.	Create a 400MB logical volume (LV) called lvol0 on volume group vg0:
     lvcreate -L 400M -n lvol0 vg0This lvcreate command will create a softlink /dev/vg0/lvol0 point to a correspondence block device file called /dev/mapper/vg0-lvol0.
8.	The Linux LVM setup is almost done. Now is the time to format logical volume lvol0 to create a Red Hat Linux supported file system, i.e. EXT3 file system, with 1% reserved block count:
    mkfs -t ext3 -m 1 -v /dev/mapper/vg0-lvol0
9.	Create a mount point before mounting the new EXT3 file system:
    mkdir /mnt/vfs
10.	The last step of this LVM tutorial – mount the new EXT3 file system created on logical volume lvol0 of LVM to /mnt/vfs mount point:
    mount -t ext4 /dev/mapper/vg0-lvol0 /mnt/vfs
11.	To confirm the LVM setup has been completed successfully, the df -h command should display these similar message:
    /dev/mapper/vg0-lvol0 388M 11M 374M 3% /mnt/vfs
